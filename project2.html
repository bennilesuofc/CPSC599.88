<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
  The Phys-Viz Auto-Harmonica physically visualizes data by playing it though a harmonica. 
  In its current implementation, the auto-harmonica maps ranges of temperature values to different notes on the harmonica. 
  Lower pitches indicate colder weather, and higher notes indicate warmer weather. 
  Each note played is one day in a year.
</p>
<p>
  The auto-harmonica changes the pitch it is playing via a sliding crank mechanism attached to a servo motor. 
  When the servo rotates to a specific position, the sliding crank moves back or forth, aligning an air tube with one of the openings in the harmonica. 
  The air tube is supposed to use a fan to propel air into the harmonica, but this is where I ran into some issues.
</p>
<p>
  I needed a fast and narrow stream of air, but none of the fans I tried were well-suited for this. 
  I tried using the motor-and-fan combo included with my Arduino kit (the airflow was too wide), a small electronics cooling fan (the airflow was too shallow), and an aquarium air pump (the airflow was too weak, and the pump was very noisy). 
  So, while the note-changing mechanism works fine, the final device is not actually capable of creating sound on its own. 
  This version of the device needs to be helped along with either a compressed air canister or oneâ€™s own breath.
</p>
<p>
  The data (daily climate reports from the Calgary International Airport for 2023) also had to be prepared for use by the auto-harmonica. 
  The data was first quantized by value into eight ranges (as only eight of the ten openings on the harmonica are being used), and then placed into a text file, where each byte of data indicates a position on the harmonica. 
  This text is then copied onto the Arduino, where it is procedurally read byte by byte, and moves the servo to the indicated position, playing the correct note. 
  This is a direct mapping of numerical ranges, but another mapping could be the relative to value of each data point against the immediately previous value or some baseline or average value. 
  Rate of change of values could also be represented by increasing or decreasing the tempo of the notes.
</p>
<p>
  Future versions of this device would hopefully solve the airflow issue, and also explore different mappings as described above. 
  As well, the unintended extra interactivity of having to blow into the air tube made me think that it might be interesting to look into data-representation devices that are human-powered on-purpose. 
  These might also have a more evident data-mapping. 
  For example, a hand-crank that displays calories burned over time.
