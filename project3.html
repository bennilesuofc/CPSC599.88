<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>
    This is the second iteration of the Tubular Touch Synth Controller (there is a link to v1 below). 
    It creates sound by interpreting a user’s input via an Arduino and the SuperCollider software. 
    The user controls the device using five tubes on its top. Instead of using light sensors like in v1, version two uses capacitive touch sensors. 
    All the player has to do is touch any of the nails on the tubes (not the pointy ends) and a note will play. 
    Raising and lowering the tubes will respectively raise and lower the pitch of each tube’s note.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most noticeable change from v1 is that the tubes are now vertical instead of horizontal.
    This is so that the device won’t slide around when manipulating the tubes. For this purpose, I also made the enclosure heavier by adding weight towards the front and left. 
    This also offsets any lifting force applied from raising the tubes. Compared to v1, v2 uses better quality parts, which made for an easier construction (no cut-up paperclips holding the circuitry together this time). 
    I used longer slide potentiometers, shorter and more flexible wires that took up less space, and I reassembled the main breadboard to make wiring the slide potentiometers easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had originally intended to use light sensors as with v1, but there were two problems to solve from that iteration. 
    First, the light sensors would easily detach from the movement of the tubes. My proposed solution was to separate them into another input platform. 
    Second, differences in ambient light levels meant that sometimes the sensors wouldn’t detect a user’s input. 
    My solution for that was to add a way to adjust the sensitivity of the light sensors, either manually or by measuring and comparing to the room’s ambient light. 
    I went ahead and created the circuitry needed to do this, but it turned out to be very complicated- rearranging the breadboard components to suit the slide potentiometers meant that I had to use lots and lots of wires to make the circuits for the light sensors. 
    I was also having difficulty trying to stabilize the secondary input platform where all the light sensors were- they kept falling out anyway. 
    I had already decided that I was going to use brass nails to move the tubes up and down (they’re a signature construction material for me at this point), so I decided to see how difficult it would be to try using them as a capacitive touch input too. 
    It turned out that both the wiring and the code was a lot simpler, and like with the first iteration of the device, I could have just one point of interaction instead of two.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides the physical construction of the device, not many changes were made to version two’s code. 
    I adjusted the Arduino code to work with capacitive touch sensors instead of light sensors, making use of a capacitance sensing library. 
    In SuperCollider, I just changed the start and end points of the two-octave range of notes that the input maps to, from a slightly sharp G above middle C to the A below middle C.
  </p>
<p>Here are some ideas I had for improving the design further:
  <ul>
    <li>For the capacitive sensors/movement guides, use metal tabs or foil-covered levers, or really anything less pointy than nails</li>
    <li>Add some way to indicate notes for the different tube positions to make tuning easier- e.g. level lines on tubes, colour gradient, lights</li>
    <li>Quantize ranges to play discrete notes</li>
    <li>Increase the sensitivity of the touch capacitive sensors- I had noticed some sensing issues when I had the Arduino plugged into my computer and my computer plugged into a wall charger- apparently, I can easily increase the sensitivity by adding more resistors into the circuit, but hopefully not so much that pressing a sensor also induces a signal in the adjacent sensors</li>
  </ul>
